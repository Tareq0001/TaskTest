## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), near-white for a clean look.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#BFA0E3), to highlight actions, which is similar to blue but different enough to grab attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, is used, appropriate for headlines and body text.
- Simple, modern icons for document actions (upload, view, delete).
- Clean, intuitive layout for easy navigation and document management.
- Subtle animations on document upload and deletion for user feedback.
